  "description": "### Idea I worked in the Automotive Industry since I was 16 and grew up in the industry as well since my Mom was a  Body Shop Manager and Service Manager throughout my entire childhood. I wanted to be a GM but wanted to do every job in the dealership so  I would know how every corner works but in Aug 2018, I started a Full-Stack Development Course at Georgia Tech. I worked with Internal Cars after almsot a year as a Service Advisor and assisting customers in the drive.Sales Personal would always come find me or page me asking about the staus of their customer cars and sometimes I would be waiting on approval on the repairs or it would be at another dealership. I had an idea to create a site that will display all the information needed so Sales wouldnt have to take time out of their day to ask me or check on the car as that in return takes time away from them making calls or assiting customers on the lot.",
